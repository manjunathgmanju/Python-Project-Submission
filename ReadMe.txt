ðŸŽ¥ Movie Suggestion Bot

Hey there! Welcome to the Movie Suggestion Bot project. If youâ€™ve ever struggled to pick a movie to watch, this bot is here to help you out.

What Does It Do?
This bot scrapes movie data from IMDb and suggests movies based on the genre youâ€™re interested in. Itâ€™s like having a mini film advisor right on your computer!

How It Works
Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup: The bot grabs movie names and their ratings from IMDbâ€™s top charts.
Data Handling with Pandas: Once the data is scraped, itâ€™s organized and filtered using Pandas, allowing you to search by genre and rating.
Error Handling: Things donâ€™t always go as planned in coding, but no worriesâ€”Iâ€™ve added error handling to keep the bot running smoothly.

How to Use It
Clone the Repo: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
Install the Dependencies: Make sure you have the required Python libraries by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Bot: In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

python movie_suggestion_bot.py

Get Your Movie Suggestion: Just enter the genre youâ€™re in the mood for, and the bot will suggest movies with decent ratings.
